            <h3><span class='multiple-text2'></span></h3>
            <p>As an enthusiastic software engineering student, I have a deep
                passion for leveraging technology to address real-world
                challenges. My curiosity and love for learning drive me to
                continuously explore new advancements and hone my skills by
                building innovative applications. <br><br>

                I am currently studying at Newcastle University and it has provided me with a robust foundation in
                computer science and
                programming, allowing me to develop a deep understanding of fundamental concepts such as algorithms,
                data structures, and programming paradigms. Through my coursework, I have gained practical experience in
                applying these concepts to real-world problems, developing efficient and scalable solutions that meet
                the highest standards of software engineering. <br><br>

                In particular, I have focused on studying modules such as algorithms, where I have learned how to
                analyze and optimize algorithms for performance, time complexity, and memory usage. I have also gained
                experience in working with various data structures such as linked lists, trees, and graphs, and
                implementing efficient algorithms for sorting, searching, and optimization.

                <br><br>Outside of the tech world, I
                enjoy participating in athletics, immersing myself in the
                exciting world of gaming, and appreciating the diverse genres of
                music. These hobbies not only keep me balanced but also help me
                approach problem-solving with a fresh and creative
                perspective. I firmly believe that by combining my technical
                expertise with my personal values and interests, I can make a
                positive impact and contribute meaningfully to the world.
